An implementation of the S3 API in Sinatra.  Most of the code was originaly taken from
ParkPlace, another S3 clone written by _why.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------

  gem install sinatra haml aws-s3

  Optional Gems

  ruby-git    - versioning

  The released version of the rubytorrent gem is not compatable with Sinatra-S3 and you
  will need to install the version found at http://github.com/nricciar/rubytorrent to have
  a working bittorrent tracker.

Install
-------------------------------------------------------

  gem install sinatra-s3
  sinatra-s3 install_dir
  cd install_dir
  rake db:migrate
  rackup config.ru -p 6060
